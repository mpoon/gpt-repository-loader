# gpt-repository-loader

`gpt-repository-loader` is a command-line tool that converts the contents of a Git repository into a text format, preserving the structure of the files and file contents. The generated output can be interpreted by AI language models, allowing them to process the repository's contents for various tasks, such as code review or documentation generation.

## Contributing
Some context around building this is [located here](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader/discussions/18). Appreciate any issues and pull requests in the spirit of having mostly GPT build out this tool. Using [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/) is recommended for quick access to GPT-4.

## Getting Started

To get started with `gpt-repository-loader`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Ensure you have GitPython installed on your system. You can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install GitPython
   ```
3. Clone or download the `gpt-repository-loader` repository.
4. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.
5. Run `gpt-repository-loader` with the following command:

   ```bash
   python gpt_repository_loader.py /path/to/git/repository [-p /path/to/preamble.txt] [-o /path/to/output_file.txt]
   ```
    Replace `/path/to/git/repository` with the path to the Git repository you want to process. Optionally, you can specify a preamble file with -p or an output file with -o. If not specified, the default output file will be named output.txt in the current directory.

6. The tool will generate an output.txt file containing the text representation of the repository. You can now use this file as input for AI language models or other text-based processing tasks.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for `gpt-repository-loader`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.
3. Run the tests with the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_gpt_repository_loader.py
   ```
Now, the test harness is added to the `gpt-repository-loader` project. You can run the tests by executing the command `python -m unittest test_gpt_repository_loader.py` in your terminal.
